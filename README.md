# Uotila for OSX

### Installation
1. `gem install ./releases/uotila-0.1.gem`
2. OSX doesn't ship with `Cellos` anymore so you need to do some magic first. Go to System Preferences => Accessibility => Speech => System Voice => Customize... & search for `Cellos`

### Enjoy!

### Command line
ruby lib/uotila.rb

### From code
Add require 'uotila' to start of your code. Uotila will be executed as soon as it is loaded. This method is good if you are incuding Uotila to your command line tool made with Ruby.

### Credits
